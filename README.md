# Arknights Farmer
Macro for Arknights stage farming (may get banned, use at your own risk)

This python script allows you to select a stage in Arknights and auto-farm it without needing you to restart the stage over and over again.
I mainly use it for in-game events that need a lot of farming in a short amount of time. I do not recommend using the script regularly because there is a major risk of getting banned.

I have added some random delays between clicks and random offsets to the position of the clicks to avoid being detected, but it might get you banned because it is COMPLETELY AGAINST the ToC of Arknights. So, use it at your own risk.

## Dependencies
 - ADB
 - Python
 - Python libraries: ppadb, pixelmatch
 ```
pip install pure-python-adb
```
 ```
pip install pixelmatch
```
 - Make sure you enabled ADB in your Android Emulator settings and the resolution is set to 1280x720 and adb is running on your PC.
## Instructions
 - Download the repo.
 - Open LDPlayer, set the resolution to 1280x720 (others don't work).
 - Open Arknights, and navigate to the stage you want to farm.
 - Select the stage and run the script, it'll start the stage and keep doing the stage over and over again until you stop the script/you run out of sanity.
