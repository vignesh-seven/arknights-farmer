# Arknights Farmer
Macro for Arknights stage farming (may get banned, use at your own risk)

This python script allows you to select a stage in Arknights and auto-farm it without needing you to restart the stage over and over again.
I mainly use it for in-game events that need a lot of farming in a short amount of time. I do not recommend using the script regularly because there is a major risk of getting banned.

I have added some random delays between clicks and random offsets to the position of the clicks to avoid being detected, but it might get you banned because it is COMPLETELY AGAINST the ToC of Arknights. So, use it at your own risk.
